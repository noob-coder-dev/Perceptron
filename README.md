## Introduction
**The McCulloch-Pitts model** was an extremely simple artificial neuron. The inputs could be either a zero or a one. And the output was a zero or a one. And each input could be either excitatory or inhibitory.

Now the whole point was to sum the inputs. If an input is one, and is excitatory in nature, it added one. If it was one, and was inhibitory, it subtracted one from the sum. This is done for all inputs, and a final sum is calculated.

Now, if this final sum is less than some value (which you decide, say T), then the output is zero. Otherwise, the output is a one.
